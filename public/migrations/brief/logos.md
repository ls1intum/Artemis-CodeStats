# Artemis client migration brief: logos

> Bootstrap → Tailwind / TUM UI. Generated from Artemis `5be30e1d` (Development: Improve input validation for assessment feedback and text block ids (#13917), https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/pull/13917). Paths are relative to the Artemis repository. Hits are class tokens matched by Artemis's own `no-bootstrap-classes` rule plus SCSS residue; a unit is done when its directory is in the lock list. Guideline: https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/blob/develop/documentation/docs/developer/guidelines/client-development.mdx

## Status

- 9123 Bootstrap hits in 584 of 1004 units; 137 units locked, 283 Bootstrap-free but unlocked
- 41 of 189 routed pages import no Bootstrap, not counting the global shell
- 80 directories can be locked now (configuration-only change)

## How to migrate

1. Convert the whole rendering closure of a unit, never half: a migrated element under a Bootstrap ancestor loses the cascade. Leave app-wide shared units (navbar, footer, delete dialog) as they are until they are migrated as their own locked units; do not put a Tailwind utility on their host.
2. Replace each Bootstrap class with the target listed for it; use the TUM UI kit component where one exists (reference: https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/blob/develop/documentation/docs/developer/tum-ui.mdx). Import kit symbols from `@tumaet/ui-angular`.
3. Convert spacing by size, not by name: Bootstrap `mb-3` is 1rem, Tailwind `mb-4` is 1rem. Replace raw colors and `--bs-*` variables in SCSS with semantic tokens (`text-state-*`, `--text-body-secondary`); delete SCSS that only restyled Bootstrap.
4. Verify locally with `pnpm migrate:check <path under src/main/webapp/app>` (prints remaining hits, exit 0 when ready to lock) and `pnpm migrate:status`.
5. When a directory is ready, add its three entries: the `.html` glob to the `files` array of the block that enables `localRules/no-bootstrap-classes` in `eslint.config.mjs`, the `.scss` glob to the `--bs-`/hex override in `.stylelintrc.json`, and the `@source` line (relative to `src/main/webapp/tailwind.css`) to `tailwind.css`. Then run `pnpm run test:rules && pnpm run lint && pnpm run stylelint && pnpm run prettier:check`, restart the dev server and check light and dark mode.

Work order: shared units with few hits and many dependants first, then units that import nothing with hits (they can be locked right after), then the rest.

## logos — 15 hits, 1 of 2 units Bootstrap-free

Units in work order (fewest imported hits first):

- `src/main/webapp/app/logos/llm-selection-popup.component.html` — 15 hits
  - `card-header`×3 → tum-ui-card / tum-ui-panel
  - `modal-backdrop`×1, `modal-content`×1, `modal-header`×1 → tum-ui-dialog
  - PrimeNG: p-toggleswitch → tum-ui-toggle-switch
  - `src/main/webapp/app/logos/llm-selection-popup.component.scss`: 8 --bs-* variables, 1 raw colors
